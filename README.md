| Num  | Model/Link             | Description                           | Authors     |
| --- | ------------------------|---------------------------------------| ------------| 
|  1 | COVID-19 Growth Rate Prediction - https://covid19dashboards.com/growth-bayes/   | We assume a negative binomial likelihood as we are dealing with count data. A Poisson could also be used but the negative binomial allows us to also model the variance separately to give more flexibility. | Thomas Wiecki, @HamelHusain
|  2 | Estimating The Mortality Rate For COVID-19 - https://covid19dashboards.com/covid-19-mortality-estimation/#Interpretation-of-Country-Level-Parameters  | Using Country-Level Covariates To Correct For Testing & Reporting Biases And Estimate a True Mortality Rate. (Github model: https://github.com/jwrichar/COVID19-mortality) | @HamelHusain, @jwrichar
|  3 | NobBS: Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing - https://github.com/sarahhbellum/NobBS  | NobBS is Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. NobBS learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings. | sarahhbellum
|  4 | Scenario analysis for the transmission of COVID-19 in Georgia - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/stochastic-GA.html  | The epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States is poorly understood. To better understand the potential range of epidemic outcomes in the state of Georgia, we developed a model based on data from Hubei Province, China calibrated to regionally specific conditions in Georgia and observations of the number of reported cases in Georgia in early March. Github - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-wuhan-stochastic-model | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  5 | Probability of widespread transmission - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/final-size.html | http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/final-size.html; Github (private) - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-coupled-outbreaks | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  6 | Spatial Spread of 2019 novel coronavirus in China - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/spatial-china.html  | We developed a gravity-based model to better understand the risk of spatial spread of the 2019-nCov at the prefecture level in China, and to determine the efficacy of quarantines imposed in Wuhan and other prefectures. Github (private) - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/CoronavirusSpatial | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  7 | Effect of early intervention on outbreak size of COVID-19 in China - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/early-intervention.html  | The epidemic of COVID-19 reached different areas of China at different times. This means that different locations were at different phases of outbreak at the time of the Wuhan lockdown (23 January) and other provincial and national actions. This provides what is sometimes called a “natural experiment” becuase it is as if replicate epidemics had been induced and then intervened on at different times. By looking at the effect of timing on outbreak size, we can draw conclusions about the effect of delaying intervention, which may be informative to other countries that are considering taking action. Github - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-early-intervention | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  8 | Effect of mass testing - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/mass_testing.html | A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak. China is currently using this strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak. However, MSTI might lead to increased transmission if not properly implemented. We investigate under which conditions MSTI is beneficial.

|  10 | Nowcasting the current size of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/nowcast.html | At any given time, most COVID-19 cases are circulating in the community and not known to us. We wish to estimate the total current size of the COVID-19 outbreak (the total number of unnotified individuals currently infected with SARS-CoV2). Github (private) https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-nowcast, Global and US Parameters http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/parameters | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  11 | Speed of Spread of COVID-19 - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/speed-of-spread.html By US State and Global  | Epidemics of COVID-19 are occuring at different times across the United States so it is important to compare the spread of an epidemic in a given state with the appropriate stage in other countries. The following figures show the cumulative number of cases in a state by number of days since the 100th case, number of days since the 1st case, and by calendar date, respectively. Github (private) https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-data-summary | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  12 | COVID-19 in Context - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/context.html  | How does the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic compare in severity to other recent disease outbreaks? We gathered data from existing studies to put COVID-19 into context. Github (private) https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-context | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  13 | Estimating $R_0$ and other parameters for the 2019-nCov epidemic | The epidemiology of the global 2019-nCov is poorly understood. Identifying the key processes that shape transmission and estimating the relevant model parameters is therefore an important task. This document presents arguments and analysis to support the estimation of a number of key quantities - Epidemic curve, Basic reproduction number ($R_0$), Case detection rate (q), Incubation period ($\frac{1}{/sigma}$), Lag between symptom onset and isolation, Transmissibility ($\beta$), Additional parameters; Notebook HTML - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/parameters-supplement.html | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  14 | Estimation of the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 outside China - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/reff-outside.html | What is the average $R_{eff}$ outside of China? | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
|  15 | COVID-19 Growth Rate Prediction - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/stochastic.html | We developed a stochastic model to better understand the transmission of 2019-nCov in Hubei (primarily Wuhan). The model includes several features of the Wuhan outbreak that are absent from most compartmental models that otherwise confound the interpretation of data, including time-varying rates of case detection, patient isolation, and case notification.

|  16 | Extended state-space SIR epidemiological models - https://github.com/lilywang1988/eSIR  | R package eSIR: extended state-space SIR epidemiological models. The standard SIR model has three components: susceptible, infected, and removed (including the recovery and dead). In the following sections, we will introduce the other extended state-space SIR models and their implementation in the package.
